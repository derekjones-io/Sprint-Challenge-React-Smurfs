**1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.**
`server-side routing` involves the delivering of a new page from the server every time a user clicks on a new page or does one of several actions that can cause a refresh. `client-side routing` involves the delivering of every page to the user immediately and the navigating is handled internally which prevents all of those extra pulls to the server. The initial load of `client-side routing` takes longer than `server-side routing`, but the page navigates much faster after that.
